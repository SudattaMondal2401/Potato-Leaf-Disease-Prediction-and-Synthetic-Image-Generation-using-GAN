# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Prediction-and-Synthetic-Image-Generation-using-GAN
A repository containing a code to detect the disease on a potato leaf using a novel CNN model. Also contains a GAN model for generating synthetic images of the diseased leaves, so as to balance the dataset without using image augmentation.
