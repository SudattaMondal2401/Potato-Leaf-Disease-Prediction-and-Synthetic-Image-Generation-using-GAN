# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Prediction-and-Synthetic-Image-Generation-using-GAN
A repository containing a code to detect the disease on a potato leaf using a novel CNN model. Also contains a GAN model for generating synthetic images of the diseased leaves, so as to balance the dataset without using image augmentation. However, since the GAN does not work as well, currently working towards using a pre-trained GAN for the same task.
